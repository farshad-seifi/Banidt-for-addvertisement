# Banidt-for-addvertisement
Imagine we have 10 possible choice for advertisement and we want to know which one is better. In order to solve this problem, here we have formulated that in a bandit problem and some optimization algorithms have been usedto solve it. Then the average result and average regret of these policies have been compared together.
Here you can see average reward per policy.
